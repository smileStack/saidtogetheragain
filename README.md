# saidtogetheragain
A human endeavor to reunite immigrant families.

##Building a fund to help immigrants who have not been able to be with their family members in a very long time.

###To start
 We will be accepting applications from those who have not been physically able to see their familes in over 4 years OR those who have family members in critical/extenuating circumstances. This could be someone who has an ill family member, wants to attend a notable life event and would not be able to do so without assitance (e.g. weddings, births, and funerals).

 Each application will be reviewed on a case by case basis, based on our rubric. 
We publish this rubric for transparency and to honor our commitment to fair treatment of all applicants.
